### googledrive.json
You are missing **googledrive.json** file, add it to .credentials directory. This file is generated by Google, and looks like this (at least at the moment):

```{  
    "installed":
    {
        "client_id":"SOME_STRING", 
        "project_id":"SOME_STRING",
        "auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
        "token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
        "auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
        "client_secret":"CLIENT SECRET",
        "redirect_uris":["URL1","URL2"]
    }
}
```

After you log in, there should be token.pickle file present in the directory as well.

### dropbox.json
You are missing **dropbox.json** file. add it to .credentials directory. This file is for Dropbox integration, and looks like this:
```
{
    "secret": "SOME_STRING",
    "key": "SOME_STRING",
    "token": "SOME_STRING"
}
```

### Google Drive structure
This is hardcoded, at some point I may change it to support other users, not just me. But for now it's quick and dirty to make it work for my diabetologist.  
At any rate, you should have directory on your Google Drive called **diabetes_registry**, containing your images.

### Dropbox application
Create your application in [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers), give it "App folder" permissions, and set the App folder name to "diabetes_reg".
